No lectures. Just services you've paid for.\n\n**Start here:**\n\n1. Call or text **211** to describe your situation\n2. Get matched with relevant programs\n3.

        question: "Will using these programs affect my credit or future job prospects?",
        answer: "No. Using SNAP, VITA, 211, or other assistance programs does not affect your credit score or appear on background checks. These are confidential services designed to help you."

      {
        question: "I had a good month—do I still qualify?",
        answer: "Possibly. Many programs look at annual income or average monthly income over several months, not just your best month. Gig workers with variable income often qualify even with occasional high-earning periods. Apply and let them determine eligibility."
      },
      {
        question: "What documents do I need to apply?",
        answer: "Typically: ID (driver's license, passport), proof of income (bank statements, 1099s, pay stubs), proof of expenses (rent, utilities), and Social Security numbers for household members. Requirements vary by program—211 can tell you exactly what you need."
      },

        question: "How long does it take to get help?",
        answer: "It varies. 211 referrals can be immediate. SNAP applications are processed within 30 days (7 days for emergencies). VITA appointments are scheduled during tax season. Healthcare enrollment depends on open enrollment periods or qualifying events."
