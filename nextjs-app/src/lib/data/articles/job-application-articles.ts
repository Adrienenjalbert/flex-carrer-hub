        question: "How do I make a resume with no experience?",
        answer: "Focus on education, skills, projects, and volunteer work. Use a functional resume format that highlights what you CAN do rather than where you've worked. Include coursework, extracurricular activities, and any certifications. Quantify achievements wherever possible."

        question: "What should a fresher write in a resume objective?",

        question: "Is a one-page resume enough for freshers?",
        answer: "Yes, one page is ideal for freshers. Employers spend an average of 7 seconds reviewing a resume—keep it concise and impactful. Only expand to two pages if you have extensive relevant projects or certifications."

        question: "Should freshers include a photo on their resume?",

        question: "What skills should a fresher put on a resume?",
        answer: "Include both hard skills (software, certifications, languages) and soft skills (communication, teamwork, problem-solving). Match skills to the job posting keywords. For entry-level roles, emphasize reliability, adaptability, and willingness to learn."

      {
        question: "How do I write achievements without work experience?",
        answer: "Draw from academic projects, volunteer work, extracurricular activities, and personal projects. Use the STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result.

        question: "Which resume format is best for freshers?",

        question: "Can I use the same resume for every job?",

        answer: "No, Indeed Flex uses profile-based matching rather than traditional ATS. Your in-app profile, photo, skills, and ratings are what businesses see—no resume parsing involved."

I listen actively, acknowledge their frustration, and focus on solutions. If I can't resolve it myself, I bring in a manager.

What do you do?\"\n\n**Sample Answer:**\n> \"I apologize for any confusion and ask to review the bill with them. If there's an error, I correct it immediately and thank them for catching it. If the charge is correct, I explain each item calmly. If they're still unhappy, I involve a manager to find a resolution.\"\n\n### \"You're overwhelmed with tables and a guest signals they need you. What do you do?\"\n\n**Sample Answer:**\n> \"I acknowledge them immediately with eye contact and a 'I'll be right with you' gesture. This shows I've seen them and they matter.

We still work together well.\"\n\n### \"How do you handle conflict with a coworker?\"\n\n**Sample Answer:**\n> \"I address it privately and directly but kindly. Most conflicts come from miscommunication. I focus on the issue, not the person, and look for solutions rather than blame. If we can't resolve it ourselves, I'm not afraid to involve a manager—letting things fester hurts the team.\"\n\n### \"What do you do when you make a mistake?\"\n\n**Sample Answer:**\n> \"I own it immediately, apologize to anyone affected, and focus on fixing it.

I frame it as enhancing their experience, not adding to their bill.\"\n\n**\"What's your approach to menu knowledge?\"**\n> \"I study the menu thoroughly—ingredients, allergens, how items are prepared. I taste everything I can. When guests ask, I give confident, personal recommendations. 'Personally, I love the salmon—the glaze is incredible' is more effective than reciting descriptions.\"\n\n**\"What would you do if someone appears intoxicated and orders more alcohol?\"**\n> \"I have a responsibility to cut them off. I'd politely say we can't serve more and offer water, coffee, or food. If they're alone, I'd offer to call a cab. I'd inform my manager and security if needed. The guest's safety and our liquor license both matter.\"\n\n### Event Staff Questions\n\n**\"How do you stay energized during long events?\"**\n> \"Preparation—I eat well before, wear comfortable shoes, and stay hydrated. During the event, I keep moving and maintain a positive attitude. The energy of a great event actually feeds my own energy.\"\n\n**\"You notice something dangerous at an event. What do you do?\"**\n> \"Safety first. If it's immediate—someone injured, fire hazard—I address it directly if safe, then immediately notify security or management. If it's a potential issue—spill that could cause a fall—I warn nearby guests, fix it if possible, and report it.\"\n\n### Hotel/Front Desk Questions\n\n**\"How do you handle an overbooking situation?\"**\n> \"Apologize sincerely, offer alternatives at comparable or better properties at our expense, and provide compensation like free night vouchers or points.
