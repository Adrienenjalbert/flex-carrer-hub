This can be anyone over 18 who you trust—a notary public, librarian, HR professional at a business center, or even a trusted friend or family member.

        answer: "Form I-9 is a paper form that all employers must complete. E-Verify is an optional electronic system that checks I-9 information against government databases. Indeed Flex uses both: you complete I-9 during onboarding, and your information is electronically verified through E-Verify. Most E-Verify cases confirm within 24-48 hours."
      },

        question: "I'm a U.S. citizen—do I still need to complete Form I-9?",
        answer: "Absolutely yes. Form I-9 is required for ALL employees in the United States, regardless of citizenship. U.S. citizens complete the same form as permanent residents and work-authorized non-citizens. You'll check \"A citizen of the United States\" in Section 1 and present acceptable documents like a U.S. passport or driver's license + birth certificate."

        question: "How long does my employer keep my I-9?",
        answer: "Employers must retain your Form I-9 for either 3 years after hire date OR 1 year after employment ends—whichever is later. If you leave a job after 5 years, your I-9 is kept for 1 more year (6 years total). Employers may store I-9s electronically."

        question: "Can my employer tell me which documents to bring?",
        answer: "No. Employers cannot specify which documents you must present. They must accept any valid document or combination from the Lists of Acceptable Documents. If an employer says \"You must bring a passport\" or \"We only accept Green Cards,\" that may be discrimination. You choose which acceptable documents to present."

        answer: "Yes, you can use it if you currently have DHS work authorization (like an EAD or valid work visa). This restriction appears on cards issued to non-citizens with temporary work authorization. You'll need to present it with a List B identity document. Cards that say 'NOT VALID FOR EMPLOYMENT' cannot be used for I-9."

Many workers use Driver's License + Birth Certificate instead."

        question: "Do I need to bring my original documents or are copies okay?",
        answer: "Original documents only. Employers must physically examine original documents—photocopies, scanned copies, and photos of documents are not acceptable. The only exception is certified copies of birth certificates, which are acceptable (and often the only version available). Keep your originals safe and bring them to your onboarding appointment."

        question: "Can I use my school ID for I-9?",
        answer: "A school ID can be used as a List B document (identity) if it contains a photograph. However, you'll still need a List C document (work authorization) to complete the combination. Most workers find a driver's license or state ID easier since they likely already have one."

        question: "What if my Green Card is expiring soon?",
        answer: "If your Green Card will expire soon, apply for renewal (Form I-90) 6 months before expiration. If you've filed for renewal and your card expires before you receive the new one, you can use the I-90 receipt notice as temporary evidence of your permanent resident status. Consider getting a U.S. passport as a permanent resident—it never needs renewal for I-9 purposes (though the passport itself expires)."

        answer: "Yes! You can start working while your SSN application is pending. Write \"Applied for\" in the SSN field on Form I-9 and provide the number to your employer once you receive it (usually 2-6 weeks). You'll still need to present acceptable I-9 documents proving your identity and work authorization."

        question: "What is 'at-will employment' and should I be worried?",
        answer: "At-will employment means either you or your employer can end the job at any time for any legal reason. This sounds scary but it's normal in the U.S. and applies to most jobs. It also means you can leave anytime without notice (though 2 weeks is courteous). Focus on doing good work—employers want to keep reliable workers."

        question: "What's the difference between an EAD and a work visa?",
        answer: "An EAD (Employment Authorization Document) allows you to work for any U.S. employer. A work visa (like H-1B) ties your authorization to a specific employer who sponsored you. With an EAD, you can freelance, take multiple jobs, or use Indeed Flex. With a work visa, you can generally only work for your sponsoring employer."

        question: "Can I work while my EAD renewal is pending?",
        answer: "Yes, if you meet the auto-extension requirements. For many EAD categories, you can continue working for up to 180 days past your EAD expiration if you filed a timely renewal (before expiration) and belong to an eligible category. Keep your expired EAD and I-797C receipt notice as proof. Check USCIS website for eligible categories."

      {
        question: "My Green Card is expiring—can I still work?",
        answer: "Yes. Your permanent resident STATUS doesn't expire—only the physical card does. File Form I-90 to renew the card. Once filed, your card validity is automatically extended for 24 months. You can continue working with an expired card plus the I-90 receipt notice. Your work authorization as a permanent resident is permanent."
      },
      {
        question: "Can employers refuse to hire me because my work authorization expires?",
        answer: "Generally, no. It's illegal to discriminate against a worker because their work authorization has an expiration date. Employers can ask if you're currently authorized and can verify documents, but they cannot refuse to hire you simply because your authorization will need renewal later. If this happens, contact the IER at 1-800-255-7688."

      {
        question: "I have an H-1B visa—can I use Indeed Flex for extra income?",
        answer: "Generally, no. H-1B authorization is employer-specific. You can only work for your sponsoring employer. Taking additional employment (even flexible work) without proper authorization could jeopardize your immigration status. Consult an immigration attorney before taking any secondary employment. Some visa categories (like H-4 EAD or L-2) do allow general employment."

        answer: "E-Verify Self Check is a free service that lets you confirm your own work authorization before applying for jobs. It uses the same database that employers use but doesn't affect your employment eligibility or create any record that employers see. It's useful for catching potential SSN or document issues before you start a job. Visit e-verify.gov/employees/self-check."

        question: "What happens if I fail E-Verify?",
        answer: "If you receive a Tentative Nonconfirmation (TNC), you can contest it within 8 federal business days and continue working while it's resolved. Most TNCs are resolved in your favor. If you receive a Final Nonconfirmation after contesting (or don't contest), the employer must terminate your employment. However, this is rare—98.8% of cases confirm automatically."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I be fired because of E-Verify?",
        answer: "An employer cannot fire you while you're contesting a TNC. If you receive a TNC and choose to contest, you have the right to continue working while resolving it. If you receive a Final Nonconfirmation (case not resolved in your favor), the employer is required to terminate employment. But this is uncommon."
      },
      {
        question: "How long does E-Verify take?",
        answer: "Most E-Verify cases are confirmed within 24-48 hours. If additional verification is needed (like photo matching), it may take longer. If you receive a TNC, you have 8 federal business days to contest, and resolution typically takes 10-20 additional business days depending on the agency workload."
      },
      {
        question: "Does E-Verify check my criminal history or credit?",
        answer: "No. E-Verify only confirms work authorization. It checks your SSN, name, and work eligibility against SSA and DHS databases. It does not check criminal records, credit history, education, previous employment, or anything else. Employers run separate background checks if they want that information."
      },
      {
        question: "I'm a U.S. citizen—do I still go through E-Verify?",
        answer: "Yes. All employees at E-Verify participating employers go through the process, regardless of citizenship. U.S. citizens' information is checked against SSA records. Most citizen cases confirm instantly. If there's a mismatch (usually a name or SSN issue), you'll receive a TNC and can resolve it with your local Social Security office."

        question: "What is E-Verify Self Check and should I use it?",
        answer: "Self Check is a free, voluntary service that lets you verify your own work authorization before applying for jobs. It uses the same databases as employers but results are private. It's helpful to catch and fix any record mismatches before you're in a new-hire situation. Visit e-verify.gov/employees/self-check to try it."
